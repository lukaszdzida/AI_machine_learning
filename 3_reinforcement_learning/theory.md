# Key principles and approaches of reinforcement learning

## Introduction

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of ML where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment. Instead of being explicitly told what the correct actions are, the agent learns by trial and error, using rewards and penalties to guide its learning. Over time, the agent’s objective is to maximize cumulative rewards through a series of actions. Unlike supervised learning (where the model learns from labeled data) or unsupervised learning (where the model uncovers hidden patterns), RL focuses on how an agent should act in an environment to achieve a specific goal.

## Learning objectives

## Key concepts in RL

RL operates through a feedback loop between the agent and the environment. Here are the core elements that define this interaction:

- Agent: the learner or decision-maker that interacts with the environment. Examples include robots, game-playing AI, and self-driving cars.

- Environment: the world with which the agent interacts, which provides feedback in the form of states and rewards.

- State: a description of the environment at a particular point in time. It provides the agent with information about the current situation.

- Action: the choice made by the agent at any given state. The agent chooses actions that lead to a new state.

- Reward: the feedback signal received by the agent after taking an action. The goal is to maximize the total reward over time.

- Policy: the strategy the agent follows in choosing actions based on the current state. A policy can be deterministic (always taking the same action in a given state) or stochastic (taking different actions with certain probabilities).

- Value function: the expected reward the agent can accumulate starting from a particular state. The value function helps the agent understand which states are more valuable in the long run.

- Q-function: also known as the action-value function, it represents the expected return from taking an action in a given state and following a policy afterward.

## Key principles of RL

### Trial and error

In RL, the agent learns by trial and error. Initially, the agent may not know which actions are best, so it tries different actions and learns from the outcomes. Over time, it improves its decision-making process based on the feedback it receives.

### Exploration vs. exploitation

One of the key challenges in RL is balancing exploration and exploitation:

- Exploration: the agent tries new actions to gather more information about the environment.

- Exploitation: the agent uses the knowledge it has already gained to maximize its reward. An effective agent must explore enough to learn about the environment but also exploit its current knowledge to maximize the cumulative reward.

### Markov decision process

RL problems are typically modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), which assumes that the future state only depends on the current state and the action taken—not on the history of states. An MDP is defined by:

- A set of states.
- A set of actions.
- A reward function.
- A transition function that determines the next state based on the current state and action.

### Cumulative rewards

The goal in RL is not just to maximize the immediate reward but to maximize the cumulative (long-term) reward. This means the agent needs to consider the future consequences of its actions and not just the immediate payoff.

### Temporal difference learning

Temporal difference learning is a key principle in RL, where the agent updates its value estimates based on the difference between successive state values. This allows the agent to improve its estimates of future rewards incrementally, rather than waiting until the end of a sequence of actions.

## Approaches in RL

There are several approaches to solving RL problems, depending on the structure of the problem and the specific goals. Below are the most common methods.

### Value-based methods

In value-based methods, the agent tries to learn the value of each state or state-action pair, which helps it make decisions. The most well-known value-based method is Q-learning.

Q-learning is an off-policy algorithm that aims to learn the Q-value of each state-action pair, which represents the expected reward of taking an action in a particular state and following the optimal policy afterward. The agent updates its Q-values iteratively using the Bellman equation:

```
Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α [ r + γ max_{a'} Q(s',a') − Q(s,a) ]
```

Where:

- Q(s, a) is the current Q-value for the state-action pair,
- s is the current state,
- a is the action taken in the current state,
- r is the immediate reward received for the current action,
- γ is the discount factor for future rewards,
- α is the learning rate,
- s′ is the new state, and
- a′ is the action that maximizes the future reward in the new state.

### Policy-based methods

In policy-based methods, the agent directly learns the policy without focusing on value functions. These methods are particularly useful in high-dimensional or continuous action spaces.

Policy gradient methods optimize the policy by adjusting the parameters in the direction of higher expected rewards. Instead of estimating value functions, policy gradients directly modify the policy using gradient descent. Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a function by iteratively moving toward the function's minimum. This is often used in complex environments, such as robotics or games.

### Actor-critic methods

Actor-critic methods combine value-based and policy-based methods. The actor chooses actions based on a learned policy, while the critic evaluates how good the actions are by using a value function. This approach helps balance the exploration and exploitation trade-off and improves the learning process.

### Deep RL

When combined with deep neural networks, RL is referred to as deep reinforcement learning (DRL). DRL allows the agent to handle complex, high-dimensional environments by using deep networks to approximate the value function or policy. Famous examples of DRL include deep Q-networks, which was used to master video games like Atari.

## Applications of RL

RL is applied across a wide range of industries due to its ability to solve sequential decision-making problems. Some popular applications include:

- Game AI: AI agents in games like chess, Go, and video games use RL to learn strategies and outperform human players.

- Robotics: RL is used to train robots to perform tasks such as navigation, grasping, and manipulation.

- Autonomous vehicles: self-driving cars use RL to learn how to navigate roads safely while optimizing for efficiency.

- Finance: RL is applied in algorithmic trading, portfolio management, and risk management by learning optimal strategies from market data.

- Health care: in personalized treatment plans, such as dosing strategies for medications, RL is used to determine the best actions to take based on patient data.
